<Title>createReaction</Title>

```ts
function createReaction(onInvalidate: () => void): (fn: () => void) => void;
```

Sometimes it is useful to separate tracking from re-execution. This primitive registers a side effect that is run the first time the expression wrapped by the returned tracking function is notified of a change.

```ts 
const [getS, setS] = createSignal("start");

const track = createReaction(() => console.log("something"));

// next time getS() changes run the reaction
track(() => getS());

setS("end"); // "something"

setS("final"); // no-op as reaction only runs on first update, need to call track again.
```
